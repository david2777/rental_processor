# Rental Processor

Simple tool for processing and filtering the weekly new rentals spreadsheet posted by
[WilliamMcCarty](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamMcCarty/submitted/) on Reddit.

Filter based on the following parameters
- Min/Max Rent
- Min/Max Bedrooms
- Min/Max Square Feet
- Pets Allowed
- Private Laundry
- Max Commute Time (using Google Maps API)

Also outputs Walkscore and Bikescore via Walkscore API.

Since the format can sometimes change there has been some work done to minimize updates when the number of 
columns changes.
